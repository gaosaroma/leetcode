# 11. Container With Most Water

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

# Approach1: One-pass
- Time complexity : O(n^2)

- Space complexity : O(1)

- Easiest but high Time Complexity

```
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        maxArea = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(height)):
                area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)
                if area > maxArea:
                    maxArea = area
        return maxArea
```



 # Approach2: Move the shorter one

- Time complexity : O(n)

- Space complexity : O(1)

- Ideas: when moving the ($l$,$r$), how to move is more effective? Move the shorter one. Because when you are at ($l_t$,$r_t$) and plans to move one of them (PS: they respectively have only one way to move), the area will be larger when move the shorter one. Moving the longer one does not work.

- Proof: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/discuss/200246/Proof-by-formula

- **~~Todo~~** **Done**: **why** and **when** shall we think in this way when encountering such a question?
	
<!--I guess it happens when we considering what is effective and useless operation in our work. Just like some operations seems to be supposed done in the process, but actually not. Just like in our lives for a specific target.-->  

```
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
		left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1

        maxArea = 0
        while (left < right):
            maxArea = max(maxArea, (right - left) * min(height[right], height[left]))
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return maxArea
```
